# Minesweeper-Project

The Minesweeper Game project is aimed at designing and implementing a digital version of the classic puzzle game. The primary objective of this project was to gain experience in software development, problem solving, algorithmic thinking while recreating a popular and challenging game.We have attached the code for the game we have created.

Instructions:
•	The goal of Minesweeper is to uncover all the squares on the grid without detonating any hidden mines.
•	The game begins with a grid of squares, which are initially covered. Each square can be either empty or contain a mine.
•	To uncover a square, you need to click on it. If the square contains a mine, you lose the game.
•	If a square does not contain a mine, it will display a number indicating the number of mines in the adjacent squares.
•	Use the numbers as clues to deduce the locations of the mines. For example, if a square displays the number "3," it means that three mines are present in the surrounding eight squares.
•	To mark a square that you suspect contains a mine, you can right-click on it or use a flag icon. This helps you keep track of the potential mine locations.
•	If you uncover all the squares that do not contain mines, you win the game.
